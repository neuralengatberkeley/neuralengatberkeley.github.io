	When we perform dexterous movements, like playing the violin or
	drawing, we monitor multiple sensory modalities to ensure our 
	movements are being executed as intended. If they arenâ€™t, 
	adjustments to movement can be made on the fly. How do 
	the dynamics of brain activity enable such rapid and seamless 
	sensorimotor interplay? <br> <br>

	The goal of our research is to uncover the network-
	level principles the brain uses to filter and integrate feedback to 
	modify ongoing behavior, and to use these principles to develop 
	neurophysiologically-grounded neurotechnology to rehabilitate and 
	restore damaged sensorimotor systems. We also
	seek to develop better assessments for measuring sensorimotor 
	integration, better tools for measuring brain activity, and more
	precise descriptions of impairments in dexterous behavior in 
	clinical populations.  <br><br>
