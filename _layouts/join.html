		We are looking to recruit research assistants/engineers, graduate students, masters students, visiting students, and postdoctoral fellows! Posting recruitments for specific positions here in Spring 2023. In the meantime, if you're interested in joining or learning more about the lab please get in touch with Preeya (pkhanna at berkeley dot edu). <br><br>

		Please include in your email your CV, a brief description of your research background and experience, the position you're interested in (e.g. graduate student, postdoc, research assistant/engineer), and a description of why you're interested in the lab. Also please note in your email if you've had research experience in any of the following areas: team software engineering projects, signal processing, AI/reinforcement learning, neurophysiological data analysis, systems/computational neuroscience, design of behavioral setups with sensors/actuators, or animal behavioral training. <br><br>

		Graduate students admitted to the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute or the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences department for Fall 2023 are particularly encouraged to get in touch about possible rotations in the lab for the upcoming 2023-2024 year. <br><br>

		Finally, we are always interested in recruiting enthusiastic postdoctoral fellows. Please get in touch -- I look forward to hearing from you! <br><br>
